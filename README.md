# Industrial-Production-Forecast-Can-the-U.K.-Surpass-the-U.S.-Again

This project analyzes and forecasts the industrial production performance of the United States and the United Kingdom from 1948 to 2024. I explored long-term historical trends and studied how both countries responded to four major economic shocks: the 1973 oil crisis, the early 1980s recession, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.One of the key findings was that the 2008 financial crisis marked a major turning point. While both countries saw a sharp drop in industrial output, the US began recovering by 2010 and steadily surpassed its pre-crisis levels. In contrast, the UK never fully recovered and remains below its 2007 baseline even in 2024. To confirm these trends, I built SARIMA forecasting models to project the next 10 years. The forecasts suggest that US industrial production will continue to grow at a modest but stable pace, while UK production is likely to remain flat or decline slightly unless significant changes occur. I also conducted a sector-wise analysis of the UKâ€™s industrial performance. Pharmaceutical manufacturing showed consistent growth, but sectors like automotive, energy supply, and capital goods have been stagnant or declining since 2016. These weak sectors are contributing to the UK's overall stagnation, in contrast to stronger recovery trends observed in US sectors like durable goods and mining. Technologies used in this project include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels for SARIMA modeling. This analysis highlights how economic resilience can be traced and projected through time series techniques and domain-specific context.
